## The one file you'll edit most: `lib/config.ts`

Everything content-related is centralized there:

- **`FEATURES.BUY_FLOW_ENABLED`** — the kill switch. Keep `false` until audit
  published + entity finalized + multisig live. Flip to `true` and the same
  reservation button becomes a real purchase button.
- `SITE` — contract address, Basescan URL, ticker, supply, TGE target
- `SOCIALS` — Twitter / Telegram / Discord / GitHub / LinkedIn
- `FOUNDER` — name, role, bio, photo path
- `PHASES` — the 5 presale phases + prices
- `ALLOCATIONS` — tokenomics breakdown (donut chart reads from here)
- `MINERS`, `ROADMAP`, `FAQS`, `WHY_FEATURES`

---

## TODO before going live

| # | Task | Where |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | Real contract address + Basescan link | `lib/config.ts` → `SITE.contractAddress`, `SITE.basescanUrl` |
| 2 | Founder photo | drop `founder.jpg` into `/public` |
| 3 | Real phase allocations (mine are estimates) | `lib/config.ts` → `PHASES`, `ALLOCATIONS` |
| 4 | Social URLs | `lib/config.ts` → `SOCIALS` |
| 5 | Brevo wiring for reservations | `app/api/reserve/route.ts` (Option A block, commented) |
| 6 | Your own bio text | `lib/config.ts` → `FOUNDER.bio` |
| 7 | Legal pages (Terms, Privacy, Cookie) | currently `#` placeholders in Footer |
| 8 | Replace estimated whitepaper numbers | `app/whitepaper/page.tsx` |

---

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` → `.env.local`:

```
BREVO_API_KEY=
BREVO_RESERVATION_LIST_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUY_FLOW_ENABLED=false
```

---

## Deploy (Vercel)

1. Push to a GitHub repo (e.g. `Or4ng3frog/qryptix`)
2. Import in Vercel → it auto-detects Next.js
3. Add the env variables in Vercel project settings
4. Point `qryptix.io` DNS at Vercel when ready to switch from the old site

---

## Fonts

Clash Display (headlines) + Satoshi (body) load from a CDN in `globals.css`.
For production reliability, consider self-hosting them in `/public/fonts`
and updating the `@font-face` URLs. JetBrains Mono loads from Google Fonts.

## Notes on the honest-marketing approach

- Reservation flow, not a live buy flow — no funds taken until audit + entity ready.
- Miners are "register interest", not purchase — no prepayment for unproduced hardware.
- Roadmap is status-coded (done / now / planned) — no fake "completed" items.
- Risk disclosure is prominent — builds trust with serious buyers.
- Real phase-based scarcity (P1→P5 price ladder) instead of fake countdowns.

When you're ready to add a legitimate bonus campaign, the
`FEATURES.BONUS_CAMPAIGN_ENABLED` flag is already stubbed in `lib/config.ts`.
